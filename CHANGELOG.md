# Changelog

All notable changes to the SquarePi installer are documented here.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Bluetooth AVRCP volume control** — bluealsa daemon now runs with `--a2dp-volume --initial-volume=25`. Phones that support AVRCP absolute volume (most Android and iOS devices) can control the output level directly from their volume slider.
- **BT Volume softvol layer** — new `squarepi_bt_vol` ALSA softvol PCM sits between bluealsa-aplay and dmix. Provides independent volume control for the Bluetooth audio path without affecting MPD or other sources.
- **BT Volume slider in EQ UI** — Gain & Balance section now includes a BT Volume slider (0–100%). Polls every 3 seconds to reflect live AVRCP volume changes. For phones without AVRCP support the slider is the manual control; for AVRCP phones it mirrors the phone's volume slider.
- **bluealsa-aplay** updated to route through `squarepi_bt_vol` with `--volume=mixer`, wiring AVRCP volume events to the softvol ALSA control.
- Default BT volume set to **25%** on install and persisted via `alsactl store`.

### Fixed
- Phones without AVRCP absolute volume (e.g. Xiaomi HyperOS) no longer connect at full amplitude — `--initial-volume=25` caps the starting level regardless of phone model.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- EQ negative band values silently failed in both Lua preset scripts and `eq-server.py`. The `amixer` CLI parses negative values (e.g. `-1`) as unknown flags without a `--` separator; the fix adds `--` before the value in all amixer calls. Affected presets: Vocal, Night Mode, Late Night, Rock, Pop, Jazz, Acoustic — all had cuts below 0 dB that never applied.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-25

### Added
- `sticker_file` in mpd.conf — enables myMPD ratings, play counts, and last-played tracking.
- `auto_update "yes"` in mpd.conf — music library refreshes automatically when files change on disk.
- `audio_buffer_size "8192"` in mpd.conf — prevents DLNA stream underruns under load.
- `input_cache "2 MB"` in mpd.conf — buffers HTTP streams against WiFi jitter.

### Fixed
- upmpdcli `protocolinfo` restricted to MP3/FLAC/OGG — stops Windows Media Player from transcoding to raw L16 PCM, which was the root cause of the distorted "kilili" sound when pushing tracks via DLNA.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **48 kHz / 24-bit audio pipeline** — dmix fixed at 48000 Hz / S32_LE; MPD format `48000:24:2` with SoXR resampler at "very high" quality. Reduces Pi clock error to 0.16 ppm and eliminates sample-rate conversion for Bluetooth (A2DP is natively 48 kHz with this config).
- **Spotify Connect** (`--with-spotify`) — installs and configures raspotify with `librespot` backend, routed to the dmix mixer.
- **AirPlay** (`--with-airplay`) — installs and configures shairport-sync, routed to the dmix mixer.
- **Sleep timer** — myMPD Lua scripts for 30 / 60 / 90 min timers and cancel, installed as part of the base install.
- **`--all` flag** — runs all five optional installs (BT, EQ, DLNA, Spotify, AirPlay) in one pass.

---

## [1.2.0]

### Added
- **Bluetooth A2DP sink** with ALSA dmix shared output — MPD and Bluetooth can play simultaneously through a shared software mixer.
- Persistent discoverable/pairable state survives reboots.
- Auto-pairing agent (`squarepi-bt-agent.py`) accepts all Bluetooth pair requests automatically.

---

## [1.1.0]

### Added
- First-boot defaults for hostname, locale, and audio output.
- README overhaul with full installation guide.

---

## [1.0.0]

Initial release — MPD + myMPD + TAS5805M driver on Raspberry Pi OS Lite.
